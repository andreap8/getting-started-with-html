  <b> INTRO TO PROGRAMMING </b> <br>
<br>
<b> Basics of Web </b><br>
  - Collection of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) <br>
- hyperlinks glues pages together <br>

<p> HTML: <br> 
- basics for everything on the web <br>
- the heart of the web <br>
  - made up of documents that can do  number of things </p>

<p> HTML is made up of: <br>
1. text content - what you see <br>
2. markup - what it looks like <br>
3. references to other documents eg. images and videos <br>
4. links to other pages </P

<p> HTML Markup: <br>
- made up of (opening tag) content (/closing tag) which is referred to as the element </p>

Tags: <br>
- b - to bold text <br>
- em - emphasis - makes text
italics <br>

<p> HTML Attributes <br>

(Tag ATTR = "value") contents (/tag) <br>
e.g. 
(a href = "www.reddit.com") derp (/a) <br>
a - anchor for making links <br>
href - attribute name <br>
www.reddit.com - link - value of the attribute <br>
derp - content - what you see on screen <br>
  closing tag </p>

Images: <br>
Tag = img <br>
(img src = "URL" alt = "text") <br>
src = source <br>
URL = location or address of the image <br>
alt = alternate response if image is not found <br>
text - text to print if image isn't found <br>
**Note - does not use a closing tag <br><br>

Tag (br) - line break - does not need a closing tag <br>
Tag (p) - paragraph - if line break need to put it around each line <br>

<p> Inline and block tags <br>
block tags puts text in invisible boxes <br>
Inline - no box <br><br>

Inline tags: <br>
b, em, br, span, strong, span <br><br>

Block tags: <br>
p, form, div <br><br>

Inline - (span class = "foo") text (/span)<br>
Block - (div class = "bar") text (/div) <br>
These do the same thing but one does in inline and the other in block </p>
